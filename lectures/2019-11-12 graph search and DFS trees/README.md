# ADTs-cplusplus
Abstract data types commonly used in Adam's courses.  In building these data structures, I borrowed ideas from [Timothy Budd](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~budd/), [Cliff Schaffer](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/), [Mark Weiss](http://users.cs.fiu.edu/~weiss/), past students (they tend to have lots of good ideas), and myself (whose good ideas are less frequenty but still pretty good).

Note that some programmers may scoff at my non-use of .h/.cpp separation for the ADT classes.  While I agree that this is certainly heresy for professional C++ development, the distiction between .h and .cpp files is less critical for my particular pedagogy.
