# Milestone 4
For this short milestone, you must go through your project and create github issues for all functionality that is missing and/or not working 100% correctly. Be sure to break up issues into their atomic (smallest) chunks.  For example, if processing keyboard input isn't 100% correct in your program, you wouldn't create a "keyboard input broken" issues.  Instead, you might break it down as follows (assuming these were actual problems).

1. Backspace doesn't delete characters
2. Up and down arrow keys into empty whitespace crashes program
3. Word wrap breaks on character, not word
4. ...(etc.)

Each issue should be created in sufficient detail such that someone else would be able to open your code and assist you on the task.  As such, it may be helpful to provide references to exact line numbers, function calls, or whatever else you suspect might be causing the issue.  

## Bonus Points
Because no coding is required for this week, I am making any coding and/or refactoring that you do during this week extra credit.  Depending on how much work you do, you will receive up to an addition 20 bonus points on this assignment.  Note that you will not receive the bonus if you do not complete the base requirements of this assignment.

## Grading
This assignment is worth 30 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Documenting all program issues in sufficent detail.
* [20pt bonus] You will receive a bonus 20 points if you continue to work on and/or refactor your project.

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, October 11, 2019.  No code checkins are required - you will be judged solely on your issue tracker content.
