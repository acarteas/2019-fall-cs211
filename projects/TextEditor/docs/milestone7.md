# Milestone 7
For our final milestone, you will allow users to sort the contents of their text editor contents.  The user should be able to select between the insertion, selection, bubble, and quick sort algorithms.  

## Example
Assume your text editor had the following contents:

```
pear apple
banana carrot peach
apricot
```

Upon applying your sorting algorithm, your file would now look like:
```
apple apricot banana carrot peach pear
```

Note that for the basic requirements, you are not required to maintain the same number of words per line; just put everything onto a single, word wrapped line.

## Bonus #1: Visualizing sorting
Instead of instantly sorting your text file, "animate" your sort by periodically refreshing the page.  Play around with an apporopriate value that threads the line between legibility and time.  Thus, using the visualized sorting algorithm, you might have the following intermediate step (depending on sorting algorithm selected).

```
apple apricot
pear 
banana carrot peach
```

Note the first line contains the sorted list and all other lines contain the remaining words.

## Bonus #2: Maintain document order
Rather than having all words sorted on a single line, instead do an "in place" sort where formatting is maintained but the words are rearranged.  Thus our final output would be:

```
apple apricot
banana carrot peach
pear
```
## Grading
This assignment is worth 100 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Regular, appropriately sized github checkins (no single-line checkins, no 1000+ line checkins)
* Lab progress checkins
* Tracking progress on your github project board and github issue tracker
* Maintaining a design diary for this assignment
* Completing the project / making reasonable progress

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, December 6, 2019.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github.  Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://forum.lumberhacks.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection.
