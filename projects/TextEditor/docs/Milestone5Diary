For this milestone I want to be able to read the data provided to us in a trie and when the user presses shift+space while typing a new
window will pop up next to the word they are typing and autocomplete the word with the correct word(they will decide) and press enter. 
If I get done before the due date I will start to work on the scrolling.

I will first work on trying to get a seperate screen when shift+space is pressed then I will do more research on tries since I do not
really know how they fully work yet.


I was able to get the window to be output but I am using alt+0 key to output the window. Now I will do some research on tries so I that
I can read the data from the txt file into it.

I am have been trying to read the text file into a string of vectors so I can then insert the data into a trie but 
for some reason I keep getting the error message I put incase the file did not open correctly. So I am trying to deal
with that problem at the moment
