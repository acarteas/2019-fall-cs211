As I started on my project for the gui editor I was having trouble getting used to visual studio. I feel the program has a lot of useful features that were demonstrated in class but it is something I will have to learn later as taking time to code is long as it is. My file paths were not going to the right folders and I knew this because it kept giving me errors about the pdcurses.h file not being registered. I took it in on the check in day and was able to get it running. I felt as though I was being rushed through a check out line. Some of my classmates had similar problems to mine with the tech but it's a learning process. The coding really overwhelmed me and I quit my job to really get through this class. One of the classmates named April mentioned she had a pdcurses how to guide on her profile for github. I really started getting into it on the weekend. I read through some of the examples such as getting the basic window set up. Some of the examples were good and others did not explain how any of the functions worked at all. I like guides that explain the parameters and what the function is intended to do. I found a youtube video by casual coder which is linked in my github project. He went through each of the functions on setting up the window much better than the how to guide. I was able to get a window up with a border and it was a satisfying feeling. I used addmvstring to put words in the window but then decided that I wanted a scrolling menu. I seen someone else have one in class and I thought it looked really cool. So I was able to get it partially working but my wattroff function is for some reason not working. I also experimented with adding color and i'm still looking at other functions for other potential uses in my gui. I put my project board issues on github and I enjoyed them because it felt as though I was making progress even if at times it didn't look like much because of studying and coding.
