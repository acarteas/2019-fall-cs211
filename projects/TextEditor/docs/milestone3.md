# Milestone 3
In our next milestone, your program must be able to write keyboard input to the screen and to be able to load and save changes made to a new or existin file.  In doing so, you will have to consider several factors:

1. How do you represent the document such that changes made persist when scrolling?
2. How can you incorporate changes into an existing document? 

## Grading
This assignment is worth 100 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Regular, appropriately sized github checkins (no single-line checkins, no 1000+ line checkins)
* Tracking progress on your github project board and github issue tracker
* Maintaining a [design diary](milestone3_design_diary.md) for this assignment
* Adding [cool links and tutorials](../../../docs/guides.md) that you encounter
* Completing the project / making reasonable progress

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, October 4, 2019.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github.  Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://forum.lumberhacks.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in this folder!* Lastly, once everything is checked in, [create a milestone 3 release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases).

## Example Walkthrough Image
Here is an image that I made running some lecture code.  Yours should look pretty similar but showing off milestone #3 features.
